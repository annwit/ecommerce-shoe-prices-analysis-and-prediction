# Shoe prices analysis and prediction

Data analysis (data visualisations) and machine learning models (decision trees, random forests) on the e-commerce dataset.
Performed on Google Colaboratory notebooks, which I linked to my GitHub account.
Dataset provided by Datafiniti's Product Database, accessed via data.world site https://data.world/datafiniti/mens-shoe-prices.



Project idea from one of DataWorkshop's (https://dataworkshop.eu/) course, which I finished.
